# bouncing-ball
This is a bouncing ball program, just a little script for fun, when you run it, a ball will appear that will bounce through your terminal, and it can adjust to the terminal size.

Disclaimer: This script has been only tested on Linux so far, if the outcome is not the expected in other OS perhaps is a matter of tweaking the sleep time
